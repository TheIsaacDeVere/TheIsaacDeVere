**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator)`**

I have extensive knowledge in technology and accounting. With great leadership experience in real life, I manage and moderate 3 Discord Partnered servers with 100k+ members each. I balance academics with my hobbies like programming and social media. Discord is my main platform. I'm a YouTube Gaming Partnered Creator and a former Minecraft player who still rules Cubecraft's Eggwars Mega Leaderboards.
