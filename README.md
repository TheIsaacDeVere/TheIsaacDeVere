" Live as you'll die tomorrow,  learn as you'll live forever. ". 

Hello, nice to meet ya. My name is Isaac W. DeVere. I possess extensive knowledge in both technology and architecture, and I take pride in maintaining a balance between my academic pursuits and personal interests such as development and social media. Discord is my primary platform for communication and collaboration.

Professionally, I am both a Developer and an Online Therapist. With over 4 years of experience in Psychology, I’ve developed a keen ability to understand people-often gaining insight into their personality through just a few of their messages.

Should you ever find yourself in need of someone to speak with—whether for technical collaboration or personal conversation—I welcome you to reach out at any time.

And above all, I hold a timeless appreciation for the elegance of jazz.

# The Table.

A council of eight equals, bound by silence and tradition.
No leader, no founder — each seat carries the same weight, yet none reveal their name.
Known only by titles etched in gold — The DeVere, The Ace, The Spade, The Crest, The Ledger, The Signet, The Ivory, The Bond — they meet in hidden estates and rain-slick halls, deciding fates behind closed doors.

No record of their existence is confirmed; only whispers speak of “eight chairs” and the silent agreements made upon them. Their influence is felt, never seen — fortunes rise and fall, empires shift, and history bends quietly in their favor.
